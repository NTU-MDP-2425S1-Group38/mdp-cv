## Getting Started

1. Create a virtual environment

```zsh
python3.11 -m venv venv
```

> [!WARNING]
> You should be using Python 3.11, since PyTorch (and related libraries) have questionable support for 3.12.

2. Activate the environment.

```zsh
source ./venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install requirements

```zsh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
