# Trained Weights

This folder contains all the trained weights. Weights are organised by model outputs with the following format.

```text
model_{YYYY-MM-DD}_EPOCHS {epochs}_{data_name}
```

This allows files to be sorted by date, with the name of the folder containing information about the number of epochs
and the name of the data file used.
