The dataset includes 1169 images.
Visual-target-cards are annotated in YOLOv8 format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Resize to 640x640 (Stretch)

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* Random rotation of between -15 and +15 degrees
* Random shear of between -14° to +14° horizontally and -14° to +14° vertically
* Random brigthness adjustment of between -25 and +25 percent
* Random exposure adjustment of between -15 and +15 percent
* Random Gaussian blur of between 0 and 1.5 pixels
* Salt and pepper noise was applied to 1.96 percent of pixels
