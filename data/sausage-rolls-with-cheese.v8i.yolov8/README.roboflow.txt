Roboflow is an end-to-end computer vision platform that helps you
* collaborate with your team on computer vision projects
* collect & organize images
* understand and search unstructured image data
* annotate, and create datasets
* export, train, and deploy computer vision models
* use active learning to improve your dataset over time

The dataset includes 1403 images.
Visual-target-cards are annotated in YOLOv8 format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Resize to 640x640 (Fit (black edges))

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* Random rotation of between -15 and +15 degrees
* Random shear of between -14째 to +14째 horizontally and -14째 to +14째 vertically
* Random brigthness adjustment of between -25 and +25 percent
* Random exposure adjustment of between -19 and +19 percent
* Random Gaussian blur of between 0 and 1.5 pixels
* Salt and pepper noise was applied to 2.28 percent of pixels

The following transformations were applied to the bounding boxes of each image:
* Salt and pepper noise was applied to 0.04 percent of pixels
